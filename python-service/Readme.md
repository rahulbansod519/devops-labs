## Python Health Service

A minimal HTTP service designed to demonstrate containerization and Kubernetes deployment patterns.

### Endpoints
- `/health` → health check endpoint for liveness/readiness probes

### Why this exists
This service is intentionally simple to focus on deployment, configuration, and reliability rather than application logic.
